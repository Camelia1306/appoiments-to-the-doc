## 🏥 Patient Appointment Manager  

Hey there! 👋 This is one of my firsts big projects, and I’m super excited to share it! 🎉  
It’s a **JavaFX app** that helps manage patients and their appointments. You can **add, update, and delete** patient records, track past appointments, and even see some cool stats like:  
- **How many days have passed** since a patient’s last appointment.  
- **The busiest months** of the year for appointments.  

And it’s flexible! The app lets you switch between **text files, binary files, and a small database** for data storage. 🗂️

## ✨ Features  
✔️ **Add, edit, and delete** patient records.  
✔️ **Track appointment history** and check when a patient last visited.  
✔️ **See stats** like the busiest months of the year.  
✔️ **Choose your storage method**: text files, binary files, or a database.  
✔️ **Neatly organized** into different layers (Entities, Repositories, Services, UI).

## 🛠️ Tech Used  
This project is built using:  
- **Java** (Core logic)  
- **JavaFX** (For the pretty UI 🎨)  
- **CSS** (To make it look nice ✨)  
- **SQL** (For database storage)

## 🏗️ How It’s Organized  
Here’s how I structured the project:  
📂 PatientAppointmentManager 
📂 domain # The "brain" – holds the Patient & Appointment entities 
📂 repository # Manages data storage (Text, Binary, or Database) 
📂 service # Business logic goes here 
📂 console # Basic console interactions (if needed) 
📂 ui # The JavaFX graphical interface 
📜 README.md # This file! 
📜 database.sql # SQL script for setting up the database 

## Thanks for checking this out! Hope you like it! ✨
